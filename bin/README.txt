This folder will include the .exe files after building the Visual Studio solution. 
Each .exe depends on the cbSDK .dll files: cbsdkx64.dll, QtCorex64.dll, QtXmlx644.dll
These .dll files are included with Central installation (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\Blackrock Microsystems\Cerebus Windows Suite\cbsdk\lib)
